# Babsketball

## Overview
Babsketball is a text-based basketball simulation game. The game features two game modes: quick game and series.

## Background

Babsketball was developed as a way to improve my programming skills, in anticipation of a future programming position.

The term 'Babdul', from which the game derives its name, originates from an inside joke within my family. Babdul is the name of a fictional basketball player who is characterized by repeatedly making mistakes.

## Deployment
Babsketball was developed using C++ in Visual Studio. The project has also been uploaded to GitHub.
